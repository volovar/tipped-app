## Notes

Main challenges came from figuring out the different implementations of navigation bars and how to set them up / style them.
Updating styling in the navigation controller but adding items in the view controller wasn't intuitive, but I eventually figured that out.
While searching for solutions, it was often hard to find a swift or storyboard based solution. Most results were in Obj-C or Swift and often not storyboards or interface builder related.
